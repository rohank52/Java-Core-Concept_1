Core Java - Theory Reference Document

1. Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

Developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) in 1995.

It is platform-independent due to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any JVM.

2. Java Features

Object-Oriented: Everything is an object.

Platform Independent: Write once, run anywhere (WORA).

Simple and Secure: Easy to learn and designed with security in mind.

Robust: Emphasizes early error checking and runtime checking.

Multithreaded: Supports multithreaded programming.

Distributed: Designed for the distributed environment of the internet.

Dynamic: Adapts to an evolving environment.

3. Java Architecture

Java Compiler: Converts source code into bytecode.

Java Virtual Machine (JVM): Interprets bytecode and executes it.

Java Runtime Environment (JRE): Provides libraries and JVM for running applications.

Java Development Kit (JDK): Includes JRE and development tools.

4. Java Data Types

Primitive Types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.

Non-Primitive Types: Arrays, Classes, Interfaces.

5. Object-Oriented Concepts

Class: Blueprint of an object.

Object: Instance of a class.

Inheritance: Mechanism where one class acquires properties of another.

Polymorphism: Ability to take many forms (compile-time and runtime).

Encapsulation: Wrapping code and data together.

Abstraction: Hiding implementation details and showing only functionality.

6. Java Control Statements

Decision Making: if, if-else, switch.

Looping: for, while, do-while.

Branching: break, continue, return.

7. Exception Handling

Mechanism to handle runtime errors.

Keywords: try, catch, finally, throw, throws.

Promotes robust and error-free code.

8. Java Memory Management

Heap Memory: Used for dynamic memory allocation.

Stack Memory: Stores method calls and local variables.

Garbage Collection: Automatic memory management feature.

9. Java Multithreading

Process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.

Threads share a common memory area.

Managed through Thread class or implementing Runnable interface.

10. Java API and Libraries

Java API: Set of prewritten packages, classes, and interfaces.

Common libraries include java.lang, java.util, java.io, java.net, etc.

11. Java Development Tools

IDEs: Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans.

Build Tools: Maven, Gradle.

12. Java Versions and Evolution

Java evolves with new versions introducing features like Lambdas, Streams, Modules, Records, and Pattern Matching.
